# Keep_nodes
Keep nodes manager

Ready build:

--use KeepNodesInstaller.exe to install and run app in windows.

Building from source:

--include.rar file contains chilkat lib  headers files in case you want to build app from source.

--dependencies: chilkat 9.5 lib.  

--libssl and libcrypto  are not required to build the project. But they are needed when starting the "release" build
--compile every python script to onefile exe (for example with pyinstaller --onefile option). Put folder "scripts" with compiled scripts near Keep_nodes.exe
